    <h1>CODING</h1>
    <id=index>
      <P> Hi my name is Sania and coding is something I think is my<BR>
        passion and it is very important to learn coding in this era as <B>internet</B> has become a<BR>
        vital part and it is now a way in which we can form a window for ourselves to the world<BR>
        It is now a way in which we can execute ourselves to the competing world outside.<BR></p>
      <p>
      <H2>Now the question is what is the actual use of coding? </H2><BR>Well then we have a clear
      answer for that and that is web designing and the use of web designing is, as the name prefers <br>
      it is used to design web pages and the basic term and the first of everything of coding is learning a <br>
      markup language namely HTML the base and foundation of every web page is done using the <B>HyperText Markup
        Language
      </B><BR></p>

        <h1>Types of tags in HTML</h1><br>
        There are two types of tags in html<BR>
        <ul>
          <li>Container tags</li>
          <li>Empty tags</li>
        </ul><br>
        <h2><b>CONTAINER TAGS</b></h2>
        Conatiner tags are the tags that contain both <i>on</i> and <i>off</i> tags.<br>
        For eg.- The tags such as < body>
          < html> are container tags and their closing tags follow respectively<br>
          </ body>
        </ html><br>
        <h2><b>EMPTY TAGS</b></h2>
        Empty tags are the tags that only contain the <i>on</i> tag.<br>
        For eg.- The tags such as < br>
          < P> do not have anyy closing tags <br>

                  < title> (for eg.)index </ Title><br>

                <b>Like every other substance in this universe every object has two basic types of uses</b>
                <ul>
                  <li>Positive uses</li>
                  <li>Negative uses</li>
                </ul>
                <h3><b>POSITIVE USES</b></h3><br>
                For every person with a positive and productive mind everything seems to have a better use.<br>
                in this case of coding we can see various engineers working day and night to create various useful
                softwares.<br>
                Using the useful codes and their highly skilled self they have made the imaginations possible.<br>
                <h3><b>NEGATIVE USES </b></h3>
                Things are similar but oppsite in the case of people with a negative and destructive attitude <br>
                and the worst they can do of their desires is hacking, breaking into people's private social media<br>
                or bank accounts are very common cases in today's world.<br>
